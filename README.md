# Coos Vs. Knights

Names of Team Members: Kenza Benlamlih and Jeffrey Yu

Project Description: This project is a one player game inpired by Angry Birds featuring the player as the coos or Macalester College against the knights or Carleton College. 

There only technical requirement to be able to run our game is Java 17/21. Our main method is in the Game class and that is where one can run our program. 

The essence of the project and the structures were inspired by the game Angry Birds. Gemini AI was used to produce the images of the coos, knights and background. 

Known Issues: 
One limitaion we adknowldege is if the vector line that maps out the trajectory of the coo currently being used goes off screen the coo may not be launched the way the player intended. 

Societal Impact: 
This game is intended to be used with a dragging motion on a mouse based on the limitations of Kilt Graphics and the development of it on a laptop. This may be restricting for someone who has limited hand motion, does not have fingers. or hands. This game may not be accessible to those with impaired vision depending on their situation.
