# Coos Vs. Knights

Names of Team Members: Kenza Benlamlih and Jeffrey Yu

Project Description: This project is a single-player game inspired by Angry Birds featuring the player as the coos or Macalester College against the knights or Carleton College. 

The only technical requirement to be able to run our game is Java 17/21. Our main method is in the Game class and that is where one can run our program. 

The essence of the project and the structures were inspired by the game Angry Birds. The graphical interface is built using Kilt Graphics, and images of coos, knights, and backgrounds were generated with Gemini AI. The physics system is inspired by common mechanisms in similar games.

Future Improvements:
In future versions, we plan to implement entities with different abilities and behaviors. For example, coos or knights may have special skills such as splitting mid-air, exploding on impact, or having enhanced speed or strength. This will increase gameplay variety and strategic options for the player.

Known Issues: 
One limitation we acknowledge is if the vector line that maps out the trajectory of the coo currently being used goes off screen the coo may not be launched the way the player intended. 

Societal Impact:
This game requires dragging motions using a mouse, due to limitations of Kilt Graphics and its development on a laptop. This may restrict access for players with limited hand mobility, missing fingers or hands, and it may also be challenging for those with impaired vision depending on their specific situation.
